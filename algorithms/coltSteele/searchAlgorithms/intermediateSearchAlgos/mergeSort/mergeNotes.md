## **Merge Sort**

- splitting
- sorting
- merging

Exploits the fact that arrays of 0 or 1 elements are always sorted
- works by decomposing an array into smaller arrays of 0 or 1 elements and then building up a newly sorted array (divide and conquer approach)

### **Big O of Merge Sort:**
- O(n log n) time complexity in best AND worst case
  - as length of array grows, the number of operations needed to complete the sort increases only at a log n rate
- O(n) space complexity
