# Radix Sort

- we do NOT make comparisons
- works on NUMBERS (usually in binary)
- exploits the fact that info about the size of a number is encoded in the number of digits
  - more digits means larger number number
- the number of times we need to "sort" using Radix is the length of the longest number
