## **Quick Sort**
- like merge sort, takes advantage of the fact that arrays of 0 or 1 elements are always sorted
- works by selecting one element called "the pivot" and finding the index where the pivot should end up in the sorted array
- once the pivot is positioned appropriately, quick sort can be applied on either side of the pivot
